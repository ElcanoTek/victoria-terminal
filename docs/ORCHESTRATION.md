# Victoria Terminal Orchestration

Victoria Terminal integrates with **All-Time-Quarterback**, our proprietary orchestrator for running agent workloads across a distributed fleet. It is designed for secure, outbound-only coordination with centralized task visibility.

## What It Delivers

- **Fleet coordination** across on-prem and cloud nodes.
- **Pull-based scheduling** so workers poll for tasks without inbound ports.
- **Centralized reporting** for status updates and run logs.
- **Attachment delivery** for task inputs and generated outputs.

If you are integrating with the orchestrator directly, the OpenAPI specification lives in `remote-runner/orchestrator-openapi.yaml`.
